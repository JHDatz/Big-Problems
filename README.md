# Big-Problems

This repository contains projects I have contributed to from the University of Pittsburgh class MATH 1103 - Big Problems. The syllabus can be found here:

A business or government entity gives a group of students a problem they would like completed, and the length of the semester to complete it. Each folder belongs to a particular project, and in each project there is a paper, poster, and computer code to show the work completed on each.
