## Plaid Panthers

This directory contains all the project information done for the Plaid Panthers team. This team continued on with the analysis of the 2020 Forbes Loaners and worked on the Predictive Positioning problem.

Our goal is to create a predictive model that assesses the ability of a position player to play each defensive position. We will be attempting to solve this using fitted regression models combined with a similarity score system to predict a player's performance a couple of years into the future.
