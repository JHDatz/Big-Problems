# 2021 - All Groups

This folder contains code relevant to both teams I worked with this year. The folders are organized as follows:

**Code-Alongs**: A demonstration of how the MySQL server or R programming can be used to recreate the results of various Sabermetrics texts.

**Presentations**: A folder of all given presentations this year by myself or my teams.

**Python Scripts and Tutorials**: A folder composed of all python scripts, or tutorials written into scripts, that applied to both groups.

**R Scripts and Tutorials**: Same as above, but for R scripts instead.

**SQL Database Generator**: Taken a bit further than in 2020, I have created a MySQL server on Amazon AWS for students to access and work with various Sabermetrics
databases. The code in this folder is a collection of R scripts which populate a MySQL server from scratch.

**Sample Data**: For first-time programmers who are struggling a bit, there are a few CSV files in this folder for them to work with to generate some ideas.

**Stored Procedures, Views, Queries, and Funtions**: A folder of all MySQL scripts prepared this semester. In future classes these scripts will become part of the
SQL Database Generator and be auto-populated into a new MySQL Server.

**To Be Cleaned Up**: A set of files that need to be worked on a bit before being moved elsewhere.
