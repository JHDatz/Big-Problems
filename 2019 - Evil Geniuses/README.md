# Evil Geniuses

This folder contains all the work of the Evil Geniuses baseball team.

DISCLAIMER: I worked far less on these projects. I was working for The Pirates and only oversaw them; I had no direct hand in the code or presentations.

**Code** contains all the code they team had put together in 2019.

The two PDFs are a letter of advice I sent to the team early on in the semester and their final paper.
