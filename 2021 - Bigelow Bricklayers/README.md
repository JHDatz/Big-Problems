## Bigelow Bricklayers

This directory contains all the work done for the Bigelow Bricklayers.

Their project is to create their own algorithm for "The Shift" in baseball, provide some data visualization of their algorithm outputs, and compare/contrast their algorithm with what current teams do now for The Shift.

The **Code** folder provides all code that was specific to the Bigelow Bricklayer's project (as opposed to being made for all groups). The subfolder **Failed Stuff** is to separate the final functional code from stuff that we tried.

The **Other Data** folder is data that we found and worked with for our project. We cannot show the primary dataset because it is proprietary, but we can show some of the publicly available information that we worked with.

**Presentation Given on 3/15/21 and 3/22/21:**
