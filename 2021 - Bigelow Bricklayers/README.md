## Bigelow Bricklayers

This directory contains all the work done for the Bigelow Bricklayers.

Their project is to create their own algorithm for "The Shift" in baseball, provide some data visualization of their algorithm outputs, and compare/contrast their algorithm with what current teams do now for The Shift.

The **Code** folder provides all code that was specific to the Bigelow Bricklayer's project (as opposed to being made for all groups).

**Presentation Given on 3/15/21 and 3/22/21:**
