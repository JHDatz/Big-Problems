    "# QCQP Convex Optimization Test\n",

    "#\n",
    "# This jupyter notebook file contains a method for finding the best positions\n",
    "# of fielders using convex optimization. We have formulated this optimization\n",
    "# to be a class of QCQP problems and the problem statement can be found in an\n",
    "# accompanying PDF of a LaTeX file.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This is an improvement on the Convex Test jupyter notebook file. This now\n",
    "# accepts more realistic constraints. But in doing so, this is now an NP hard\n",
    "# problem and the minimum found is no longer guaranteed to be the global\n",
    "# minimum. I also found the optimizer to be a bit finnicky and need to be\n",
    "# restarted to avoid numerical overflow.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Important future considerations:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. I still maintain that something needs to be added to the objective function\n",
    "# or the constraints to account for run value. As it stands now we treat high\n",
    "# run-value and low run-value batted balls with equal importance.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. Other methods of problem solving, such as evolutionary programming, are also\n",
    "# likely viable with enough legwork.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. I had to use Python 3.6 as well as CVXpy 0.4.9 and scipy 0.1.1 to make this\n",
    "# work. QCQP has not been updated to keep up with more recent editions of CVXpy.\n",
