# Forbes Loaners

This folder contains all the work done in 2020 for the Forbes Loaners group.

**Position Problem**: Reflects the code that we wrote over the semester for our problem on predicting the need the reposition a player. Mostly built during April
2020.

**Presentations**: A folder containing all presentations that we gave during 2020.

**SQL Database Generator** was a means to increase student access to data by auto-populating a MySQL server on their computers. The code for this comes largely from
modified code of the book *Analyzing Baseball Data with R.* This was built mostly during March 2020.

**Scraping**: Is the result of code I had written over the semester to scrape injury data from various websites. This code was worked on from January to March of
2020 as it was finished a month ahead of schedule.
